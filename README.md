# TheVoid
A website to track events and gigs in the city of Glasgow, Scotland.


The intention of this project is to create a website/flyer to keep track of all of the gigs and events going on in small DIY venues in and around Glasgow.  The focus of this project is to bring more awareness of small venues, bands, and events to try and revitalise the Glasgow art and music scene.

This is inspired by the Marseille project called "The Vortex" which is a monthly flyer that documents gigs and other events available in a group of venues located in and around Marseille, France.
